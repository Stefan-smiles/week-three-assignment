This project had a lot of different working parts and trying to maintain all 
of those parts simultaneously whilst adding the necesarry work to develop the
work led to a lot of issues. most of which involved me having to comb through 
my code only to learn I had made div soup. I am pleased to say that I feel I am
starting to get the hang of Javascript to manipulate a site that I can create 
and feel I have acheived the desired results. I did feel like the way the upgrades 
in the API were laid out though left it a little too easy to complete the game 
quickly so I added a layer or two to make it a little more compicated;
for example in my cookie clicker 10 cookies will buy you on grandma/ Oven
10 grandmas will buy you one super granny, 10 ovens will buy you one super ovens
and 10 super grannies and 10 super ovens will buy you 1 kitchen.

If I had had more time I would have done more upgrades but other than that I feel 
proud of my work. I know one of the stretch goals was to add sound effects but I 
feel that sound effects negatively impact idle games and can ruin a perfectly good
game but I hope to try and implement them in the next work.
